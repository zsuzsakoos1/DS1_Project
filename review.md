# Review Report
## Overall
I think she did a great job with her project.

- The data cleaning process is thorough and well-documented. I particularly liked how he handled missing values represented as '..' strings.
- Her code is clean and easy to follow, with clear comments explaining each step.
- The exploratory data analysis is focused on a clear research question about regional GDP comparisons.
- The visualization is well-formatted and professional, with proper labels, titles, and a clean aesthetic.
- I appreciated the proper use of pathlib for file management and the inclusion of output saving functionality.
- The type conversion from object to float was handled correctly after dealing with missing values.
## Reproducibility report
- Yes, I could run the analysis after some modifications.
- I encountered an "access denied" error when running the !pip freeze > requirements.txt command, which suggests a permission issue with writing to the current directory. I had to modify the PROJECT_ROOT path to Path(r"C:\Users\xyn") to successfully run the notebook. The setup requires directory permissions that may not be available on all systems.
## Suggested ideas
- The !pip freeze > requirements.txt command needs write permissions. Consider adding a try-except block or checking for write permissions before executing this command, or moving it to a writable directory.
- Small typo in comment: "fomatting" should be "formatting"

In a word, I think she did an excellent job with the analysis and visualization. I would give her 13/15 points(path dependencies that required manual intervention).
